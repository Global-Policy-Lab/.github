# Global Policy Lab GitHub
Note that while many Global Policy Lab repositories are hosted under the organization, there are also many repositories that are hosted under individual accounts. For this reason, code for specific projects is hyperlinked below:

- Sherman et al (2023) [Global High Resolution Estimates of the Human Development Index](https://github.com/lukesherman/hdi_downscaling_mosaiks)
- Druckenmiller and Hsiang (2018) [Accounting for Unobservable Heterogeneity in Cross Section Using Spatial First Differences](https://github.com/hdruckenmiller/SFD)

## Contributing to our code base
We encourage those people using our code to make contributions to our codebases. While some code must persist unchanged for replication purposes, other code bases, such are designed to be continuously expanded. For questions, contact Luke Sherman via lsherman@berkeley.edu
